# React 
## 💡 What it does:
 🔍 Displays all blog posts
 ➕ Create a new post
 📝 Edit existing posts
 ❌ Delete posts easily

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools Used:
- React
- JSON Server (db.json) as a fake REST API
- Axios for API requests
- React Icons for adding cool icons
- Bootstrap for basic styling
  
## 📦 Installation & Setup:
   Here’s a quick rundown of the setup if you want to try building something similar:
   ### Install dependencies
    - npm install axios
    - npm install react-icons
    - npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
    - npm install -g json-server
    - npm install react-router-dom

   ### To run JSON Server (on port 5000)
    - json-server --watch db.json --port 5000

   ### To start the React app (with Vite or similar setup)
    - npm run dev

## This project gave me practical experience with:
- React hooks like useState and useEffect
- Basic CRUD operations
- React Router for navigating between pages
- Using fetch to interact with a fake REST API
- Managing form inputs and component state

## 📦 Backend: 
- JSON Server (db.json) — super helpful for front-end devs!
